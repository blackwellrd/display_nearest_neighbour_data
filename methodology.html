<p>All the above fields are scaled by <strong>centring</strong> the values by subtracting the mean of the values from each value and then <strong>scaled</strong> by dividing the centred values by the standard deviation of the centred values.</p>
<p>The Euclidian distance between pairs of organisations are calculated as follows, the distance between <strong>organisation p</strong> and <strong>organisation q</strong> is</p>
<p>$$(d, q) = \sqrt{(p_1 - q_1)^2 + (p_2 - q_2)^2 + \cdots + (p_{k} - q_{k})^2}$$</math-renderer></p>
<p>where <b>k</b> is the number of variables used in the matching process.</p>
<p>These distances are calculated for all points $$\frac{n * (n-1)}{2}$$for <strong>practices</strong> that is $$\frac{(6333 * (6333 - 1))}{2} = 20,050,278$$ and for <strong>PCNs</strong> that is $$\frac{(1271 * (1271 - 1))}{2} = 807,085$$</p>
<p>The top <b>n</b> (in the example we will use the top 10) closest organisations are used as the nearest neighbours</p>

<p>The same scaling process as above is used and the clustering method used is K-means</p>
