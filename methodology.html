<p>All the above fields are scaled by <strong>centring</strong> the values by subtracting the mean of the values from each value and then <strong>scaled</strong> by dividing the centred values by the standard deviation of the centred values.</p>
<p>The Euclidian distance between pairs of organisations are calculated as follows, the distance between <strong>organisation p</strong> and <strong>organisation q</strong> is</p>
<p>$$(d, q) = \sqrt{(p_1 - q_1)^2 + (p_2 - q_2)^2 + \cdots + (p_{134} - q_{134})^2}$$</math-renderer></p>
<p>as we have 134 variables used in the population, QOF achievement and prevalence, IMD domains and underlying indicators, and primary care workforce data.</p>
<p>df_practice_data_matrix</p>
<p>These distances are calculated for all points $$\frac{n * (n-1)}{2}$$for <strong>practices</strong> that is $$\frac{(6455 * (6455 - 1))}{2} = 20830285$$ and for <strong>PCNs</strong> that is $$\frac{(1265 * (1265 - 1))}{2} = 799480$$</p>
<p>The top n (in the example we will use the top 5) closest organisations are used as the nearest neighbours</p>

<p>The same scaling process as above is used and the clustering method used is K-means</p>
